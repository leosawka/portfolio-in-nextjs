    greeting: 'Welcome to my portfolio!',
    about: "I am Jairo Leonardo Olivera Sawka, a fullstack developer based in LATAM with experience as a semi-senior developer at a multinational company based in London, England, United Kingdom. I have over 7 years of professional experience developing scalable Web Applications using Python, Django, Javascript (React.js, Node.js), and SQL databases. In my career I have worked from the full product development lifecycle, including backend architecture, API integration, interfaces, and containerization with Docker, to production support, bug fixes, and technical advice in cross-functional teams, which is even more important in a fast-paced environment. More recently I have been involved in AI development with hands-on projects, including a working LLM powered chatbot, and an object detection system using YOLOv8, using a structured version control system. I think that I can bring a combination of technical depth, communication skills, and ability to adapt to a given scenario on any project, and I strongly enjoy the opportunity to problem-solve in the real-world through clean coding practices, thoughtfully designed architecture, and a strong focus on learning.",
